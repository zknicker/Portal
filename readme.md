# Portal

## Hey there!

I created this 3D scene of a magical portal while following the https://threejs-journey.com/ course on Three JS. All assets are created using Blender, and the final product is rendered using NodeJS & ThreeJS.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
